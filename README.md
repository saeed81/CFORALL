hobbyc is a hobby C programming language practice!
As a big fan of C programming language, I devote my free time to write some C functions. It is started by implementing a vector container 
for integer values. Any feedback is appreciated. I always believe that C language makes me a good programmer as it gives me 
the fundamental tools and i have  more time to practice rather than just learning. It is because C is terse but powerful.
Long live C!!!
